In June 2023, JP Morgan agreed to pay $290 million to settle claims from over 100 victims. Internal communications revealed that bank employees, including senior executive Jes Staley, were aware of concerns about Epstein's conduct. The U.S. Virgin Islands also sued JP Morgan, and the case was settled for $75 million in 2023.",

The suit alleged girls as young as 12 were transported to Little St. James for exploitation. The case settled in December 2022 for $105 million plus half the proceeds from property sales. AG George was subsequently fired after filing a separate $190 million lawsuit against JP Morgan, reportedly under political pressure. The USVI AG office also sued JP Morgan, eventually settling for $75 million.",

The DOJ Inspector General report documented extensive failures by BOP staff: guards did not check on Epstein for approximately eight hours before his death, his cellmate was transferred without replacement, surveillance cameras near his cell malfunctioned, and staff members were found to have been sleeping and browsing the internet rather than performing required rounds. Two guards were charged with falsifying prison records but reached deferred prosecution agreements. MCC New York was permanently closed in 2021.",
