    "detailedDescription": "Jeffrey Edward Epstein (1953-2019) was an American financier and convicted sex offender who operated a sex trafficking network exploiting dozens of underage girls over at least two decades. Born in Brooklyn to a working-class family, he taught at the Dalton School before entering finance at Bear Stearns (1976-1981), then founded his own financial management firm. His sole publicly known client was billionaire Leslie Wexner, through whom Epstein acquired immense wealth, properties, and a private jet. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor under a controversial non-prosecution agreement that shielded him and co-conspirators from federal charges. He was arrested again in July 2019 by SDNY on sex trafficking charges and died in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 2019. The NYC Medical Examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging.",

Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in 2019 that prosecutors did violate the CVRA but could not award damages. The Eleventh Circuit ruled 7-4 that the CVRA does not give victims the ability to enforce rights until charges are formally filed, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2022. A 2025 congressional bill strengthening victims' protections was named the 'Courtney Wild Reinforcing Crime Victims' Rights Act.'",

Her reporting directly led to the FBI and SDNY reopening the Epstein case, Acosta's resignation as Labor Secretary, and Epstein's July 2019 arrest on new federal charges.

A December 2025 DOJ document release included an email from a federal prosecutor stating that flight records revealed Trump traveled on Epstein's jet 'many more times than previously has been reported.' Trump's name appears in Epstein's black book with multiple phone numbers. In 2002, Trump told New York Magazine that Epstein was 'terrific' and a 'lot of fun.' Their relationship reportedly soured, and an FBI memo released in 2026 documented a 2006 phone call in which Trump encouraged Palm Beach Police Chief Reiter in his investigation of Epstein. Trump has stated he was never close to Epstein and had a 'falling out' with him. No survivor has made public allegations of wrongdoing by Trump in connection with Epstein.",

He became Epstein's client in 1987 when Epstein became his financial advisor. In July 1991, Wexner took the extraordinary step of granting Epstein full power of attorney over his trusts and foundations, allowing Epstein to hire people, sign checks, and buy and sell properties on his behalf. Through this relationship, Epstein acquired hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, a private plane, the 9 East 71st Street Manhattan townhouse, and a luxury estate in Ohio, all previously owned by Wexner or his companies. Wexner stated he severed ties with Epstein in 2007 after discovering misappropriated funds. In 2008, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation and Epstein's Financial Trust Company contributed a combined $46 million to a Wexner foundation. The nature of Wexner's relationship with Epstein and the true source of Epstein's wealth remain among the most scrutinized aspects of the case.",
